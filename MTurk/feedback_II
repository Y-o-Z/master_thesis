<p &1><b>There is a capitalization error in this sentence.</b></p>
<br &1>
<p &1>Some general rules:</p>
<br &1>
<p &1>Capitalize the pronoun "I".</p>
<p &1>Capitalize the first word of every sentence.</p>
<p &1>Capitalize names (Julia, Romeo), locations (Allenby Street, Switzerland), languages (English, French), companies (Amazon, Ikea), and religions (Christianity, Paganism).</p>
<p &1>Capitalize days (Monday), months (January), and holidays (Christmas), but not seasons (spring, summer, autumn, winter).</p>
<p &1>Capitalize historic events (World War II) and time periods (Roaring Twenties, Great Depression).</p>
<br &1>
<p &1>If these rules do not apply, you might consider using lowercase instead of uppercase.</p>

<p &2><b>There is a wrong plural usage in this sentence. Singular should be used instead.</b></p>
<br &2>
<p &2>Some general rules:</p>
<br &2>
<p &2>Uncountable nouns appear almost always in singular. If one can put “much” in front of a noun (much luck, much happiness), then it is most likely uncountable and should be used in singular. If one can put “many” in front of a noun (many wishes, many presents), then it is most likely countable.</p>
<p &2>Adjectives do not have a plural form. The noun changes but the adjective remains the same (one nice house and two nice houses).</p>
<p &2>Some words require the singular: each (each cat), every (every dog), one (one person). A specific combination that also requires the singular is “a + … + noun” (a car, a big train, a huge ship, …).</p>

<p &3><b>There is a wrong singular usage in this sentence. Plural should be used instead.</b></p>
<br &3>
<p &3>Some general rules that might help:</p>
<br &3>
<p &3>If a sentence refers to more than one instance of a countable noun, the plural is required (two books, five poems, a lot of essays, multiple trees, …).</p>
<p &3>Many English words form the plural by adding an “s”. Transform singular to plural by appending an “s” (carrot + “s” = carrots). If the noun ends with “-s”, “-ss”, or “-ch”, form the plural by adding “es” (bus + “es” = buses, dress + “es” = dresses, lunch + “es” = lunches).</p>

<p &4><b>One word (noun or verb) in this sentence has a wrong ending and is potentially missing an “s” at the end.</b></p>
<br &4>
<p &4>Some general rules:</p>
<br &4>
<p &4>The correct verb form for the third person singular (he, she, it, the dog) can often be built by adding an “s” to the end of the verb (learn + “s” = learns). If the verb ends with “-ss”, “-sh”, ”-ch”, or “x”, add “es” (miss + “es” = misses, wash + “es” = washes, catch + “es” = catches, fix + “es” = fixes). If the verb ends with “-y”, remove the “y” and add “ies” (study - ”y” + “ies” = studies).</p>
<p &4>Many English words form the plural by adding an “s”. Transform singular to plural by appending an “s” (cucumber + “s” = cucumbers).</p>
%
<p &5><b>One word (noun or verb) in this sentence has a wrong ending with potentially an “s” too much at the end.</b></p>
<br &5>
<p &5>Some general rules:</p>
<br &5>
<p &5>Apart from the third person singular (he, she, it, the dog), the correct verb form for the present is almost always the verb base form. To go from third person singular to base form, it is often enough to remove the “s” at the end (e.g. learns - “s” = learn).</p>
<p &5>Many English words form the plural by adding an “s”. Transform plural to singular by removing an “s” (cucumbers - “s” = cucumber).</p>

<p &6><b>There is a verb form error in this sentence.</b></p>
<br &6>
<p &6>Some general rules that might help:</p>
<br &6>
<p &6>The so-called past participle (learned) is used (among other things) to talk about things in the past (I have learned). It is often enough to add “ed” to the end of a verb to get the past participle (play + "ed" = played). If the verb ends with “-y”, remove the “y” and add “ied” (study - “y” + “ied” = studied). If the verb ends with “-e”, just add a “d” (believe + “d” = believed).</p>
<p &6>To find the verb base form from the past participle, you can apply these same rules in reverse.</p>

<br &7>
<p &7>Some general rules:</p>
<br &7>
<p &7>The so-called present participle (talking) is used to indicate a duration or an ongoing activity (he was talking for 10 minutes). The present participle is formed by adding “ing” to the end of a verb.</p>
<p &7>The present participle cannot stand alone. The verb “to be” is often used as a helper (I am walking, they were running), but other verbs can also execute that function (we enjoy flying).</p>
